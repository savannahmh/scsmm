                <p>Every business is unique. We start with a thorough background check. Who are you? How long have you been in business? Who are your competitors? What kind of rankings do they have online versus yours? Do you have an internal marketing team? Do you have a current marketing plan we could integrate online marketing with? Do you have a website, blog, or email subscriber list? Did you know these are the best ways to reach leads and track conversions? These are all part of the recipe for a great online marketing plan. Depending on your current budget and needs, we will find a way together to increase revenue and gain long-lasting customer relationships.</p>

                        <p><strong>Consultation</strong><br>During our consultation, we will ask a lot of questions to determine your business background and how we can help you.

                        <p><strong>Pitch Strategy</strong><br>It is important to voice any goals, ideas, or potential issues during the consultation. At the pitch phase, we will put our research and strategy into a document that explains what, when, and where we will be creating and posting. We outline SPECIFIC goals and metrics that will be used to determine our success. </p>

                        <p><strong>Get to Work</strong><br>We research and monitor daily, while creating the content for your social sites. You will recieve a weekly report showing those specific metrics showing any engagement, revenue, or lead increase. We only sign 3-month contracts with new businesses, as this is the average amount of time it takes to build, monitor, and record your target audience and their behavior (such as the best times to post, what type of posts convert, etc.).</p>
